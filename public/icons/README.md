# Icons

Please add the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16px icon for the extension
- `icon48.png` - 48x48px icon for the extension
- `icon128.png` - 128x128px icon for the extension and Chrome Web Store

You can use any design tool (Figma, Photoshop, etc.) to create these icons. The icons should represent the NotOnlyTranslator brand and concept.

## Design Suggestions

- Use a book or translation-related symbol
- Consider using blue/purple color scheme
- Keep design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use any placeholder images or generate simple colored squares using online tools.
